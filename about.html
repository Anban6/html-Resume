<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Anban.G.R, a passionate self-taught computer science enthusiast with a background in Electronics and Communication Engineering from SRM University, Chennai, India.</p>

<p>Though my formal education was in electronics, my interest has always been more aligned with computer science. This led me to teach myself various skills and tools related to the field. I am skilled in SQL databases, have studied automation testing using Selenium, and can code in Python. I am currently expanding my knowledge in web development.</p>

<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
<p>I have 3 years of experience working at Amazon India, where I was part of the Machine Learning team and the Catalogue team for the Amazon Catalogue division. This experience has given me a deep understanding of the tech industry and has fueled my desire to pivot towards more software-based roles.</p>

<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>When I'm not coding or learning about new technologies, I enjoy reading books, especially fiction and fantasy genres. I'm also a history buff with a particular interest in historic wars.In addition, I have a passion for cooking, particularly Indian and Western cuisines.</p>
